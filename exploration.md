## Exploration 004: Engineering ethics

### 1. Study

This section contains a sampling of ethics in technical fields, directly or indirectly related to computer engineering. As usual, there is a rich variety of subdomains, niches, and specifics.

### 2. Apply

1. The Association for Computer Machinery is the premier computer engineering professional society. Read the [ACM's Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). _How does it mesh with your prior understanding of what computer engineering is about? Did you get a new perspective on an aspect that you hadn't considered up to now?_
2. We live in the era of open source. So much so that even Microsoft has an [Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). _What does it address? At whom is it targetted? According to it, what is the most important element of ethical behavior when it comes to OSS? What OSS from Microsoft have we been using in our course?_
3. We also live in the age of big data. Data drives everything, from science and medicine, to technology and society. Read this article on [Data Ethics](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.2016.0360) from the Royal Society. _What is the main ethical aspect that is hinted at or stated in regards to data?_
4. The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) is the premier conference on general machine learning in the world, and one of the most prestigious publication venues in the field. It will be held [virtually](https://icml.cc/) this year! Read ICML's [Code of Conduct](https://icml.cc/public/CodeOfConduct). _Why does a technical conference need its very own Code of Conduct? Use the contents to answer the question._
5. Artificial intelligence is the most advanced subfield of machine learning. There have been a lot of fear about how AI may be misused or even how a competitive and/or hostile superintelligence may evolve from our current work in AI. Google, as one of the foremost developers of large-scale AI, felt compelled to publish [Principles of AI Development at Google](https://ai.google/principles/) (also [here](https://ai.google/static/documents/responsible-development-of-ai.pdf)). _What does Google appear to be concerned with? What kind of responsibility are they talking about?_
6. Even though it might at first sound like an _oxymoron_, the term _Ethical Hacking_ is not only a thing, but it is so serious a thing, that it has its own training and certifications. Read about the [Certified Ethical Hacker](https://www.eccouncil.org/ethical-hacking/) provided by the International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants, as well as the [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/) organization which [matches companies and hackers](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-hackers-can-help-backblaze-and-the-ethical-hackers-on-hackerone/). _Tease apart the initially inconsistent, as it might appear at first, phrase "ethical hacking". That is, say a bit about "ethics" and "hacking" (as negatively construed), and then discuss how we can attach them together._
